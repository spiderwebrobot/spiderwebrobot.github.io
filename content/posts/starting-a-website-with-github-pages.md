Once you have a [GitHub account](/posts/creating-a-github-account) we can move on to creating a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) website:

1. [Sign in](https://github.com/login) to GitHub
2. Create a [new repository](https://github.com/new)

On the “Create a new repository” page:

1. Select an option from the **Owner** dropdown menu, e.g. `spiderwebrobot`
2. Enter the **Repository name**, e.g. `spiderwebrobot.github.io`
3. Select the “Public” option from the **Choose visibility** configuration
4. Turn “On” the **Add README** configuration
5. Click on the **Create repository** button

If all went well, you should be redirected to the new code repository for your website, e.g... https://github.com/spiderwebrobot/spiderwebrobot.github.io

## Wait for it...

Nice work! You have just created a new GitHub Pages website. It may take some time, but you should eventually see the **repository name** up and running, e.g. https://spiderwebrobot.github.io

If you see a 404 page, no worries, just check back in 5 to 10 minutes. In the meantime, check out [What is DNS propagation?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/dns-propagation) to read about any delays.
